# Example Issue Resolution Workflow

This document illustrates the complete workflow for how `useful1` automatically resolves GitHub issues.

## 1. Original Issue

```
Title: Button color inconsistency in dark mode
#42

The primary button in the header maintains its light blue color even when dark mode is active.
This causes poor contrast and accessibility issues.

According to our design system, primary buttons should change to a darker blue (#1a56e8) in dark mode.
```

## 2. Developer Comment

```
@devleader:
This is a simple CSS fix. We need to modify the ThemeProvider component to apply the correct color
in dark mode. The button class should have its color changed to #1a56e8 when the theme is set to dark.
This can be found in src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx.

Assigning to @useful1 to implement this fix.
```

## 3. Issue Assignment
